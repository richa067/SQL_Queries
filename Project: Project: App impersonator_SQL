Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!)
and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

/* What does the app's SQL look like? */
CREATE TABLE fitness_first (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT,
    workout_type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER);

INSERT INTO fitness_first (name, workout_type, minutes) VALUES ("Katrina", "running", 50);
INSERT INTO fitness_first (name, workout_type, minutes) VALUES ("Mel", "jumping", 15);
INSERT INTO fitness_first (name, workout_type, minutes) VALUES ("Don", "running", 30);
INSERT INTO fitness_first (name, workout_type, minutes) VALUES ("Deb", "swimming", 60);

SELECT * FROM fitness_first;
UPDATE fitness_first SET minutes = 55 WHERE id = 1;
SELECT * FROM fitness_first;
DELETE FROM fitness_first WHERE id = 2;
SELECT * FROM fitness_first;
